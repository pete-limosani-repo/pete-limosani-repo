## Peter Limosani - Flutter Code Repo

#### Thank you for taking the time to explore my Flutter development work!

This github contains four repositories: 

**_song_pursuit_** - My first full scale flutter appâ€¦ It helps music groups build their repertoire. This app was created before I learned bloc and clean architure, so you can see the early growth in my Flutter learning.

**_sound_apps_core_** - From the next two apps, I pulled all the refactorable stuff up into a common library.

**_fiddle_tune_of_the_month_** - Helps musicians master 12 new fiddle tunes in a year.

**_whispered_recipes_** - My first paying gig as a flutter engineer. Recipe sharing app with a tilt toward familial favorites.

All four apps will run on iOS or Android. They have not ben fully tested on any other platform. All four app repo contain a README.MD with details about the app, how to use it, and a discussion of how I leveraged Flutter/Dart technologies.

### Song Pursuit

Song Pursuit is built using a Cloud Firestore database. You can build the app for iOS or Android and it will connect to a sample database so you can explore the app.

### Sound Apps Core

Sound Apps Core is a library with common routines and core framework code used in the next two apps. You will need to download this code and put it in the same directory as the next two projects.

### Fiddle Tune of the Month

Fiddle Tune of the Month is built using a Cloud Firestore database. You can build the app for iOS or Android and it will connect to a sample database so you can explore the app.

### Whispered Recipes

Whispered Recipes is built using a Cloud Firestore database. You can build the app for iOS or Android and it will connect to a sample database so you can explore the app. This app is also in beta testing on the App Store and Play Store. I can set you up with credentials if you'd like to explore the app from the stores.
